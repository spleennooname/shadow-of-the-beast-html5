16-bit Amiga classic title remaking with HTML5 and [PandaJS](http://www.pandajs.net/).

**Shadow of the Beast** is a side-scrolling platform video game produced by [Reflections Interactive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubisoft_Reflections) and published by Psygnosis in 1989. The original version was released for the [Commodore Amiga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_Amiga), and was later ported to many other systems. Shadow of the Beast is considered revolutionary at the time, because of its graphics, with many more colours on screen and up to twelve levels of parallax scrolling backdrops, were of a level rarely if ever seen before in action games. 

This is my attempt to recreate the same feeling with HTML5 and [PandaJS](http://www.pandajs.net/).
